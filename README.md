#Auction House

The Auction House ember application was designed with universal collectors in mind. An awesome platform built to allow someone to create
auctions and show the items present at each auction.

## Usage

To use the app run
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
Navigate in your browser to localhost:8000. 

 From the main page you can create a new auction, add items to the auction and then go to the all items page to see every
 item that is being sold all together on the site. You can also remove an auction which will remove all child items. You can also remove the items
 from the master list page as well.
